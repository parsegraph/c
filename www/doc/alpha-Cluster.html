<h1>Alpha Cluster</h1>
Cluster is where the information from blocks, blocktype, color and face
actually gets put to use. It figures out how to draw the blocks that have
been added to it so that they can be drawn inside of 1 Matrix Push/Pop. It
would probably not be efficient to put a lot of moving objects inside of a
single cluster as the cluster would have to be continuously updating
everytime a block was edited.
