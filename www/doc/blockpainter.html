<h1>Parsegraph BlockPainter</h1>
BlockPainter paints variably rounded blocks (from square edges to circular buds), as well as lines.
<h3>new parsegraph_BlockPainter(gl, shaders)</h3>
Creates a new BlockPainter using the given WebGL context. Shaders is a map of shader names to
their program IDs, allowing for reuse between many painters.
<h3>.bounds()</h3>
Returns the computed bounding rect for all the blocks rendered by this painter.
<h3>.borderColor()</h3>
Returns the border color used for future drawing commands.
<h3>.setBorderColor(borderColor)</h3>
Sets the border color used for future drawing commands.
<h3>.backgroundColor()</h3>
Returns the background color used for future drawing commands.
<h3>.setBackgroundColor(backgroundColor)</h3>
Sets the background color used for future drawing commands.
<h3>.initBuffer(numBlocks)</h3>
Initializes the painter for painting up to the specified number of blocks.
<h3>.clear()</h3>
Releases GL resources, resets all counters, and resets the computed bounding rect.
<h3>.drawBlock(cx, cy, width, height, borderRoundedness, borderThickness, borderScale)</h3>
Draws a block, centered at the given world coordinates, of the specified size (also in world coordinates). borderRoundedness is a value between zero and one, inclusive, where zero is square and one is circular. borderThickness is a value between zero and one, inclusive, where zero is no border, and one is a completely filled border. borderScale is used to scale the border values so that they appear proportionate.
<h3>.render(world)</h3>
Uses this painter's WebGL context to draw all specified blocks transformed using the given world matrix.
