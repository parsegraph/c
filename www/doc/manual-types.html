  <h1>Graph Types</h1>
  <p>
    A <a href="graph-Room">room</a> is created by reifying each of its children
    using the defined type of that child. In order to add new content to a
    graph, so that others can view and change that content, a new type must be
    created. Each kind of content shown by a parsegraph is manage by its type.
    The <a href="/doc#Examples">demos</a> do not use the graph type system
    because they are designed to only show one kind of content.
