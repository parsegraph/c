<h1>Parsegraph JavaScriptWidget</h1>
A widget for editing JavaScript files. Requires Esprima.
<h3>new parsegraph_JavaScriptWidget(graph)</h3>
Creates a widget using the given graph that models the loaded JavaScript file.
<p>
<h3>.buildChild(child, inDir)</h3>
Builds a child node in the given direction. The caret is left at a position
where another child node could be spawned in that direction.
<p>
Some children do not nest themselves, so they will consist of several nodes
in a given direction. This means that popping back to before the child was created
will not yield a place for a node to be spawned in that direction. This is not
as common as the child consisting of a single node, so it must be the case to
keep in mind when constructing trees.
<pre>
| downward inDir
+== forward spawnDir
|
</pre>
inDir should be either parsegraph_INWARD, parsegraph_FORWARD, or parsegraph_DOWNWARD.
<h3>.buildBody(ast, inDir, spawnDir)</h3>
Builds each child node of a given AST node, creating the first bud in the inDir, and
then spawning each subsequent bud in the spawnDir direction.
<ul>
<li>If spawnDir === parsegraph_FORWARD, then the child graph will be downward and centered.
<li>If spawnDir === parsegraph_DOWNWARD, then the child graph will be forward and narrow.
</ul>
<h3>.load(url)</h3>
Loads, parses, and displays the JavaScript file at the given URL.
